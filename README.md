# youssefsgames
Contains all of my games and projects

All of these projects are Visual Studio projects. Therefore the structure of the files in each folder is created by Visual Studio. 
For people who are new to Visual Studio, you can find the latest stable compiled version of the .exe game file in the Release folder.

This repository has two branches: Development and Master. You will find the stable files on the Master branch, while the latest compiled
version (although not stable) can be found on the Development branch.

Once again, this is just something I do in my spare time, I am in no way committed to this.
